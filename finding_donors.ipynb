    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace\n",
    "* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Naive Bayes is a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes Theorem.  It can be used for email classification, facial recognition and categorizing news.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths: easy to build and scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses: NB models are often beaten by models properly trained and tuned using other algorithms. It's essentiall called \"Naive\" because of a core assumption with conditional dependence.  Features that are independent from one another rarely hold true in the real world.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Why: The data set has many categorical variables that can each be featured and compared for classification. Naive Bayes is a simple algorithm based on conditional probability.  Naive Bayes performs well in case of categorical input variables compared to numerical variable(s).\n",
    "____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees can also be used for classification.  There use can be implemented in fraud detection, CRM, and fault diagnosis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths: As with regression, classification trees perform very well in practice. They are robust to outliers, scalable, and able to naturally model non-linear decision boundaries.  The data set that we are working with contains a total of 103 features.  Decision Trees are good at modeling categorical data and the outputs are easily interpretable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses: prone to overfitting which could require ensemble methods to correct.  Trees can be unstable. A small change in the data can lead to a large change in the structure of the optimal decision tree. For data including categorical variables with different number of levels, information gain in decision trees is biased in favor of those attributes with more levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why: Decision Trees should work well for the data set  because of the many categorical features.  Decision trees handle categorical variables well and should help the charity organization with classification and finding individuals with the right income level.  \n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ada Boost is an esemble method that is a strong learner and essentially \"boosts\" our weak learner, decision tree.  It can be used in fraud detection, and or credit decisions, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Strenghts: ADAboost maximizes accuracy and minimizes the errors.  It punishing errors in the weak learner. It combines multiple classifiers to increase the accuracy of classifiers. AdaBoost is an iterative ensemble method. AdaBoost classifier builds a strong classifier by combining multiple poorly performing classifiers so that you will get high accuracy strong classifier. In each iteration, it tries to provide an excellent fit for these examples by minimizing training error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses: Prone to overfitting and can result in larger test error\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why: AdaBoost can be used to boost the performance of any machine learning algorithm. It is best used with weak learners. We can use ADAboost to compliment our categorical heavy Decision Tree and in turn create a better acccuracy model.  \n",

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",

    "The F score is a measure of a test's accuracy. We can use it to look past the two scores for precision and recall. The F1 score is the harmonic average of the precision and recall. An F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0. When comparing our three models, AdaBoost has the highest accuracy as well as F-score on the testing set. ADAboot performs well across training set sizes and doesn't shows signs of overfitting.  Therefore, ADAboost should be used when building the model.\n",

    "DT's and Naive training accuracy and F-score is almost a perfect 1 in the training set.  Essdentially both of these models are overfitting the data. We want to avoid overfitting when building our model.  It's an indicator that our model has memorized the data within the set\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost requires very little  more time to train and predict when compared to the other models.  However, ADAboost tops the other models in accuracy and F-score. Because we want to identify the correct individuals, accuracy is crucial and should be given more weight than time.

    "Boosting combines weak learners to create a strong learner. A weak learner is any machine learning algorithm that gives better accuracy than simply guessing. A simple guess has a 50/50 outcome.  Think about two teams playing one another, a random guess at the winner is 50%.  Or flipping a coin, there is a 50/50 chance at heads or tails.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is done by building a model from the training data, then creating a second model that attempts to correct the errors from the first model. Models are added until the training set is predicted perfectly or a maximum number of models are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to set weights to both classifiers and data points (samples) in a way that forces classifiers to concentrate on observations that are difficult to correctly classify.  It will help CharityML identify target individual with higher incomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "After each classification iteration, weights will be redistributed to make sure to give importance to misclassified observations and so that these observations will have a higher probability to appear in the next classification iteration. This process is done sequentially in that the two weights are adjusted at each step as iterations of the algorithm proceed. This is why Adaboost is referred to as a sequential ensemble method — ensemble referring to a type of learning that combines several models to improve the final predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "After classification training, classifiers weight is calculated and attributed to accuracy. Larger weights are given to classifiers with better accuracy. \n",

    "In a very simplified manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a weak learner.\n",

I didn't think about the outcome of individuals refraining from donation because of potential losses that they face in the markets.  To a degree a loss of wealth would add up after a capital loss and then a donation.  Capital Gain is interesting, additional wealth may lead to a donation.  Regardless, people in this position should take advantage of the potential tax deduction a donation provides.  I think this also ties directly into individuals with wealth over or under $50k.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
